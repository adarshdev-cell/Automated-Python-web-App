# Flask Application with Automated CI/CD Pipeline on Azure VMs

This repository contains a Flask web application with an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, deployed on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). The pipeline is triggered by a GitHub webhook, automating the build, test, and deployment processes. Two Azure VMs are used: one for hosting Jenkins and the Flask application, and the other for users to access the deployed Flask application output via a web browser.
